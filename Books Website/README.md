This is a book exploration website (kind of like goodreads) <br>
It just shows a few books (hardcoded). Clicking on the Read Cover Page button displays the cover page of the book. <br>
Clicking on a different book automatically closes the old cover page and displays the new one. <br>
The cover pages are scrolled to the centre for view <br>
Made the website reponsive for different window sizes (minimizing/maximizing window will not disturb the layout)
