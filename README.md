This is a book exploration website (kind of like goodreads) <br>
It just shows a few books. Clicking on the Read Cover Page button displays the cover page of the book. <br>
Clicking on a different book automatically closes the old cover page and displays the new one. <br>
The cover pages are centred to view <br>
Made the website reponsive for different window sizes (minimizing/maximizing windw will not disturb the layout)

Tried to mimic the behaviour of Sixt's car booking website
(clicking upon a car displays its price and other details below its row and aligns it to the centre for view)
